# Verilog LED Blink Controller

## Introduction

This Verilog-based LED blink controller module is designed for the Arty Z10 FPGA board. It provides precise control over the blinking frequency of an LED using an input clock and switches. You can easily customize the LED's behavior by adjusting the switch inputs.

## Features

- Adjustable LED blink frequencies from 1 Hz to 100 Hz.
- Designed for the Arty Z10 FPGA board.
- Provides an example of digital design using Verilog.
- Suitable for educational purposes and FPGA projects.

## Prerequisites

Before using this module, make sure you have the following:

- Xilinx Vivado installed for synthesis and implementation.
- An Arty Z10 FPGA board for testing.
